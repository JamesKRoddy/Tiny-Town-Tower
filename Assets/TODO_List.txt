More complex task animations and animation effects handle by animation state machine behaviours

TODO Large things:

_________________________________________________________________________



At the moment:
***Hunger system***



Have to do some refactoring on the npc animator and what has access to it





***NEXT*** Camp default is the camp selection!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Also have to check this works after exiting out of 



Cleaning system
NPCs have to use toilets, need to figure out timers for when they need it



I think the npc work state needs to have a system for walking towards different work points (like faming and cleaning) picking stuff up and dropping it off somewhere.



Damaging buildings: ties into turret system
Repairing buildings: wait until damage is finished








***Cleanliness system****
Create prefabs/scriptable objs for:
CleaningStation



Narrative diologue and recruiting NPCs






Displaying npc mutations (chariteristics)
