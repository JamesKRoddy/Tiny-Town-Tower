More complex task animations and animation effects handle by animation state machine behaviours

TODO Large things:

_________________________________________________________________________

When Im back:
Refactor after making dirt pile a task
Just have to make it use the stuff in the base class rather than in its own class
Have issues swapping the work progress and cleaning times
Have to make sure the player can also interact with it



At the moment:
Checking that the cleaning station works
Have to see what the bins actually do!



Have to do some refactoring on the npc animator and what has access to it






***NEXT*** Camp default is the camp selection!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Also have to check this works after exiting out of 



Cleaning system
NPCs have to use toilets, need to figure out timers for when they need it



I think the npc work state needs to have a system for walking towards different work points (like faming and cleaning) picking stuff up and dropping it off somewhere.



Damaging buildings: ties into turret system
Repairing buildings: wait until damage is finished




***Hunger system***
Canteen building
Able to select it and queue cooking items
Farms to produce food



***Cleanliness system****
Create prefabs/scriptable objs for:
CleaningStation



Narrative diologue and recruiting NPCs
