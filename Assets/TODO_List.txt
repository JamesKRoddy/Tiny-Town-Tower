*****Current Work*****

Finalizing game loops:

Camp management:

Clean system:
Next ppl get sick, stop working completely
Buildings to work on:
Check cleaning station still works
Toilet

Health system for settlers:
The dirtier the camp is the more likely settlers will get sick
Settlers not treated will die, recover or turn to zombies eventually (this is just based on their age and luck)
They can increase chances of recovery by not working or even better receiving treatment.
Buildings to work on:
Medical


Tomorrow work:
Day/Night cycle and npcs getting tired
NPC sleep state and beds





Bugs and refactoring:
Add a visual queue for when a settler is starving
The TimeDisplayUI has a CanvasGroup used to affect ui elements as a group maybe use in other places? Can be used to make elements not interactable use this on the building, cooking etc menus!!
The game manager should have references to the managers childed to it, they shouldn't be singletons

Add to save load manager:
Construction, repair and destruction sites
Time of day


******Stuff for later******



VFX for player

NPCs have to use toilets, need to figure out timers for when they need it

Damaging buildings: ties into turret system
Repairing buildings: wait until damage is finished

SaveLoadManager, have to implement saving/loading research, player data?, other player data for camp?, building data, cleaness and electricity, manager data? (? just means the ai put TODO there but not sure exactly what it means or what data is needed)

Enviromental hazzards in the roguelike section enviromental hazzards, electrical/acid etc.

Filling out the overworld, having more options of buildings to select.

Create more room/building prefabs

Filling out sound and VFX

Visual effects from elemental weapons eg. zombies get shocked by electrical weapon, they freeze and particles are emitted.

Setup some new enemies: Zombie that when its killed splits into smaller enemies. Different types of robots and drones.

Implement a day/night cycle for the entire game. Figure out what happens in the camp while youre gone, does progress on stuff freeze? Does it keep going or does it progress but slower?


*****Ideas*****

Enemies

Mutations

Research
Strength that allows you to push heavier objects to open new areas
