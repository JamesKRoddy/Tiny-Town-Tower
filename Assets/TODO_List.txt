*****Current Work*****

Finalizing game loops:

Camp management:

Clean system:
Next ppl get sick, stop working completely
Buildings to work on:
Check cleaning station still works
Toilet

Health system for settlers:
Settlers not treated will die, recover or turn to zombies eventually (this is just based on their age and luck)
They can increase chances of recovery by not working or even better receiving treatment.


Tomorrow work:
Status effects, adding sleep, work etc effects to npcs
Also damage ones like fire electric, poison etc.
Effects for work task buildings (camp fire smoke etc.)
Create debug menu that controls the in game time to fast forward game time




Bugs and refactoring:
Add a visual queue for when a settler is starving, sleeping, tired, sick
The TimeDisplayUI has a CanvasGroup used to affect ui elements as a group maybe use in other places? Can be used to make elements not interactable use this on the building, cooking etc menus!!
The game manager should have references to the managers childed to it, they shouldn't be singletons
If you create a second construction site not all npcs move onto the second one after completing the first, think its because the task has been marked as occupied
Pressing b after selecting a bed locks the controls
Refactor the rest of the _TaskState to reduce repetition of code
Still some issue with the melee zombie bugging out between hits while being close to the player
Sometimes 2 npcs can sleep in the same bed unassigned bed
Time manager is running in the main menu
Research upgrade, cooking and research not progressing correctly (add a progress bar or something to see how its progressing)
NPCs not returning to work after sleeping
Switching between mouse and controller controls on the fly


Errors:
Building prefab AI_Prop_Makeshift_Tent_02 must have a Building component!

Add to save load manager:
Construction, repair and destruction sites
Time of day


******Stuff for later******



VFX for player

NPCs have to use toilets, need to figure out timers for when they need it

Repairing buildings: wait until damage is finished

SaveLoadManager, have to implement saving/loading research, player data?, other player data for camp?, building data, cleaness and electricity, manager data? (? just means the ai put TODO there but not sure exactly what it means or what data is needed)

Enviromental hazzards in the roguelike section enviromental hazzards, electrical/acid etc.

Filling out the overworld, having more options of buildings to select.

Create more room/building prefabs

Filling out sound and VFX

Visual effects from elemental weapons eg. zombies get shocked by electrical weapon, they freeze and particles are emitted.

Setup some new enemies: Zombie that when its killed splits into smaller enemies. Different types of robots and drones.

Implement a day/night cycle for the entire game. Figure out what happens in the camp while youre gone, does progress on stuff freeze? Does it keep going or does it progress but slower?


*****Ideas*****

Enemies

Mutations

Research
Unlock vaulting and dash for roguelike to increase movement options
Strength that allows you to push heavier objects to open new areas

Buildings:
An alarm that will alert NPCs of an incoming zombie attack
