*****Current Work*****


Tomorrow work:
Recruiting NPCs:
First off use the RogueLikeBuildingManager to generate either friendly or hostile rooms denoted by RogueLikeRoomType
If a single friendly room is added the room parent is friendly so all rooms are friendly for that room parent to block the enemy spawning process.
Specific rooms with friendly interaction (no enemies) and finding npcs in them hostile does the currently implementation of spawning enemies
Narative options so the player can chose to add them to the camp.
Once one is recruited maybe store it in the npc manager, then when the player gets back to the camp its spawned in?


Randomly generating npcs, stats, models etc. in the npc manager.



Enviromental hazzards in the roguelike section enviromental hazzards, electrical/acid etc.

Filling out the overworld, having more options of buildings to select.

Create more room/building prefabs

Filling out sound and VFX

Visual effects from elemental weapons eg. zombies get shocked by electrical wepon, they freeze and particles are emitted.

Setup some new enemies: Boomer that runs towards you and explodes (elemental  variety too so the explosion leaves damage areas). Zombie that when its killed splits into smaller enemies.



Extras:
Instead of spawning enemies from the same points, add in code to select random points on the nave mesh to spawn, spawn points!!!
Implement a day/night cycle for the entire game.
Figure out what happens in the camp while youre gone, does progress on stuff freeze? Does it keep going or does it progress but slower?
Trash spawning in camp should take up spaces on the grid
Goal at the start just says survive, recruit 10 survivors



Bugs and refactoring:
In game quit button doesn't exit the game
Theres these small, medium and large enums for room sizes that need to be removed




******Stuff for later******

VFX for player
Damage animation for player and cooldown to take more damage
Start setting up the player progression manager. Use this to keep track of what the player has unlocked

Have to do some refactoring on the npc animator and what has access to it

Refactoring of managers, specifically the camp manager that yoke is doing a lot of stupid shit around the grid

NPCs have to use toilets, need to figure out timers for when they need it

Damaging buildings: ties into turret system
Repairing buildings: wait until damage is finished

Narrative diologue and recruiting NPCs
