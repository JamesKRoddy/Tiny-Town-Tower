Genetic Mutation Fixes

Tomorrow:

While a mutation is selected pressing b sets selected game object back to mutation button
Test with differnt shapes



Picking up genetic mutations and assigning them to the player, opening the screen placing them, showing mutation details when highlighted, exit popup to let player know unequipped ones will be dropped, discarding unequipped ones.

Instead of spawning enemies from the same points, add in code to select randow points on the nave mesh to spawn, spawn points!!!

Displaying npc mutations (charicteristics)

Implement a day/night cycle for the entire game.
Figure out what happens in the camp while youre gone, does progress on stuff freeze? Does it keep going or does it progress but slower?


Zombie sound effects
Enviromental hazzards, electrical/acid etc.
Visual effects from elemental weapons eg. zombies get shocked by electrical wepon, they freeze and particles are emitted.
Expanding the overworld, having more options of buildings to select.
Creating more rooms and buildings.
Setup some new enemies: Boomer that runs towards you and explodes (elemental  variety too so the explosion leaves damage areas). Zombie that when its killed splits into smaller enemies.



Bugs

Player feels sticky when running into walls at an angle
Player moving through walls while attack animation is running
Enemy still doing attack flash while dead
Have to review the room spawning grid system, I think just to get rid of it and have the rooms spawn in a line, currently the grid can cause rooms to spawn over the entrance






******Stuff for later******

Have to do some refactoring on the npc animator and what has access to it

Turret selection with default controls will have to do the same/tie in with TURRET_CAMERA_MOVEMENT	

NPCs have to use toilets, need to figure out timers for when they need it

Damaging buildings: ties into turret system
Repairing buildings: wait until damage is finished

Narrative diologue and recruiting NPCs
