*****Current Work*****

Genetic Mutation Fixes

Tomorrow:

While a mutation is selected pressing b sets selected game object back to mutation button
Test with differnt shapes


Things to do for a demo:

Turret refactor so they are used in the camp to kill zombies
Remove navigation stuff just let them be place wherever
Spawn in a building site first for npcs to build them
Spawning enemies in the camp make them attack buildings or turrets
Have to figure out what to do with the npcs? Maybe a bunker or something they can hide in is a new building! Upgrading increases durability and number of npcs that can fit in it.

Enviromental hazzards in the roguelike section enviromental hazzards, electrical/acid etc.

Filling out the overworld, having more options of buildings to select.

Create more room/building prefabs

Filling out sound and VFX

Visual effects from elemental weapons eg. zombies get shocked by electrical wepon, they freeze and particles are emitted.

Setup some new enemies: Boomer that runs towards you and explodes (elemental  variety too so the explosion leaves damage areas). Zombie that when its killed splits into smaller enemies.



Longer elements:
Instead of spawning enemies from the same points, add in code to select randow points on the nave mesh to spawn, spawn points!!!
Implement a day/night cycle for the entire game.
Figure out what happens in the camp while youre gone, does progress on stuff freeze? Does it keep going or does it progress but slower?







Bugs

Player feels sticky when running into walls at an angle
Player moving through walls while attack animation is running
Enemy still doing attack flash while dead
Have to review the room spawning grid system, I think just to get rid of it and have the rooms spawn in a line, currently the grid can cause rooms to spawn over the entrance
Pressing B while moving an already place mutation breaks the menu, just dont allow B presses






******Stuff for later******

Have to do some refactoring on the npc animator and what has access to it

NPCs have to use toilets, need to figure out timers for when they need it

Damaging buildings: ties into turret system
Repairing buildings: wait until damage is finished

Narrative diologue and recruiting NPCs
