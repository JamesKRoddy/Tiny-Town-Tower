*****Current Work*****

Roguelike Complete Level


Process:

Screen going black after opening a door then showing again when in the next room (add this into the scene transition manager, have it happen for the loading screen too, disable controls)
UI to display wave start and end
Add in a bit of a delay between entering the room and spawning enemies
Block interactions with doors/weapons etc. while wave is active
Visual queues on open doors when waves finished
Game loop of entering a building, completing waves, moving onto the next room, reaching the end of the building, transporting back to the overworld to the entrance of the building entered, either returning to camp or progressing onto another building.
Player death loop, loosing the npc and loot, loading back to the camp

Picking up genetic mutations and assigning them to the player, opening the screen placing them, showing mutation details when highlighted, exit popup to let player know unequipped ones will be dropped, discarding unequipped ones.

Instead of spawning enemies from the same points, add in code to select randow points on the nave mesh to spawn, spawn points!!!

After returning to camp adding picked up inventory items back to the inventory, unpossess npc, remove their genetic mutations.
Displaying npc mutations (charicteristics)

Implement a day/night cycle for the entire game.
Figure out what happens in the camp while youre gone, does progress on stuff freeze? Does it keep going or does it progress but slower?


Zombie sound effects
Enviromental hazzards, electrical/acid etc.
Visual effects from elemental weapons eg. zombies get shocked by electrical wepon, they freeze and particles are emitted.
Expanding the overworld, having more options of buildings to select.
Creating more rooms and buildings.
Setup some new enemies: Boomer that runs towards you and explodes.



Bug!
RuntimeNavMeshBuilder: Source mesh SM_Wep_Bat_01 does not allow read access. This will work in playmode in the editor but not in player

******Stuff for later******

Have to do some refactoring on the npc animator and what has access to it

Turret selection with default controls will have to do the same/tie in with TURRET_CAMERA_MOVEMENT	

NPCs have to use toilets, need to figure out timers for when they need it

Damaging buildings: ties into turret system
Repairing buildings: wait until damage is finished

Narrative diologue and recruiting NPCs
