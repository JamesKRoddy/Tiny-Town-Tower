More complex task animations and animation effects handle by animation state machine behaviours

Have to setup resource upgrade buildings, tasks and scriptable objs

Queuing up tasks!!!!! i.e. the menu doesnt close after slecting just one, you can keep seleting more. Executing them in order.
Cooking should be on a building basis, store lists of tasks there

On completing tasks is getting down to 1 and not reaching 0
Assigning more tasks is not reassigning the npc to do more


Research is on a camp basis


******

So basically when you assign cooking work to an npc if there are tasks lined up just have them complete the queued up tasks
If there are no tasks then open up the menu and start adding cooking tasks
Have the button UI reflect this ie (it says "Queue cooking tasks" or "Cook food")

TODO Large things:


Upgrading buildings
Damaging buildings
Repairing buildings
Removing work from NPCs



Things to look at:

Required resources on work tasks, are not needed, should be assigned automatically, have to look at this
