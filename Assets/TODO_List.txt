More complex task animations and animation effects handle by animation state machine behaviours

TODO Large things:

_________________________________________________________________________



At the moment:
***Hunger system***



Have to do some refactoring on the npc animator and what has access to it



***NEXT*** Camp default is the camp selection!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Seting work/buildings and assigning npcs to them
removing CAMP_CAMERA_MOVEMENT and replacing it with a slightly different version of CAMP_WORK_ASSIGNMENT
will have to do the same/tie in with TURRET_CAMERA_MOVEMENT

Flow->Select building->Open popup-Make selection and open approriate screen

Popup contains options:

View queue (where applicable) STILL LEFT!!!!! build manager line 85

	



Cleaning system
NPCs have to use toilets, need to figure out timers for when they need it



I think the npc work state needs to have a system for walking towards different work points (like faming and cleaning) picking stuff up and dropping it off somewhere.



Damaging buildings: ties into turret system
Repairing buildings: wait until damage is finished








***Cleanliness system****
Create prefabs/scriptable objs for:
CleaningStation



Narrative diologue and recruiting NPCs






Displaying npc mutations (chariteristics)
