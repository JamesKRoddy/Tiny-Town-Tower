*****Current Work*****

Finalizing game loops:

Camp management:

Clean system:
Next ppl get sick, stop working completely
Buildings to work on:
Check cleaning station still works
Toilet

Health system for settlers:
Settlers not treated will die, recover or turn to zombies eventually (this is just based on their age and luck)
They can increase chances of recovery by not working or even better receiving treatment.


Tomorrow work:
Research upgrade, cooking and research not progressing correctly (add a progress bar or something to see how its progressing)
So have to figure out how to actually control this. Since buildings can have multiple different tasks have to use the one thats being done. need to show only one progress bar at a time on the building.
UI code doesn't seem to work well i think we overlay the bar on the building in world space.



Bugs and refactoring:
The TimeDisplayUI has a CanvasGroup used to affect ui elements as a group maybe use in other places? Can be used to make elements not interactable use this on the building, cooking etc menus!!
Effect Manager TODO Show floating text, Implement healing interface or system


NPCs not returning to work after sleeping
Switching between mouse and controller controls on the fly
Destroying a building freezes the npcs and they just keep working for some reason


Errors:
Building prefab AI_Prop_Makeshift_Tent_02 must have a Building component!

Add to save load manager:
Construction, repair and destruction sites
Time of day


******Stuff for later******

Add in some poise damage for enemy and player attacks which dictate if knockback animation should play

Need some close range attacks for ranged zombies

VFX for player

NPCs have to use toilets, need to figure out timers for when they need it

Repairing buildings: wait until damage is finished

SaveLoadManager, have to implement saving/loading research, player data?, other player data for camp?, building data, cleaness and electricity, manager data? (? just means the ai put TODO there but not sure exactly what it means or what data is needed)

Enviromental hazzards in the roguelike section enviromental hazzards, electrical/acid etc.

Filling out the overworld, having more options of buildings to select.

Create more room/building prefabs

Filling out sound and VFX

Visual effects from elemental weapons eg. zombies get shocked by electrical weapon, they freeze and particles are emitted.

Setup some new enemies: Zombie that when its killed splits into smaller enemies. Different types of robots and drones.

Figure out what happens time wise in the camp while youre gone, does progress on stuff freeze? Does it keep going or does it progress but slower?

Status effects, adding sleep, work etc effects to npcs Also damage ones like fire electric, poison etc. Effects for work task buildings (camp fire smoke etc.)

Test upgrade and destruction effects for buildings


*****Ideas*****

Enemies
Slower animations for injured enemies

Mutations
One that shows enemies life bars

Research
Unlock vaulting and dash for roguelike to increase movement options
Strength that allows you to push heavier objects to open new areas

Buildings:
An alarm that will alert NPCs of an incoming zombie attack
