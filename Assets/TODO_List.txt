TODO Large things:



*********Player playing as the robot!

Now able to interact with npcs, do tasks manually.

Have to see what happens when kicking an npc off the work

Update SelectionPreviewButton w/ robot

Robot is getting through too quickly and i dont think its snapping into position

*******TODOOOOOOOOOO have to refactor this system after because its gotten very messy.
Overall human controller thats being assigned work is on the work manager, then tasks are assigned to it!
