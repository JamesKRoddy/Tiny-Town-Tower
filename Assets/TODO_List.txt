*****Current Work*****

Current Testing:
npcs running to bunkers if avalible, NPCs entering/exiting bunkers
Try a full wave with turrets killing zombies

First start wave ui
Wave counter to display time until its over
Either killing all zombies or time out to end wave
Have to clear out zombies so almost like a reload but id say just fade out, remove zombies, then fade back in
Make sure this loops works!





To Test:

Enviromental hazzards in the roguelike section enviromental hazzards, electrical/acid etc.

Filling out the overworld, having more options of buildings to select.

Create more room/building prefabs

Filling out sound and VFX

Visual effects from elemental weapons eg. zombies get shocked by electrical wepon, they freeze and particles are emitted.

Setup some new enemies: Boomer that runs towards you and explodes (elemental  variety too so the explosion leaves damage areas). Zombie that when its killed splits into smaller enemies.



Extras:
Instead of spawning enemies from the same points, add in code to select randow points on the nave mesh to spawn, spawn points!!!
Implement a day/night cycle for the entire game.
Figure out what happens in the camp while youre gone, does progress on stuff freeze? Does it keep going or does it progress but slower?
Swap out basic enemy animations for better ones.
Have to review the enemy nav agent and root motion animation link because it is not good.
Enemy animator walk types and idle is super janky, specifically around not having targets then finding a new target, need a better way of organizing that.
Main menu start button is being unselected.








Bugs

Player feels sticky when running into walls at an angle
Player moving through walls while attack animation is running
Enemy still doing attack flash while dead
Have to review the room spawning grid system, I think just to get rid of it and have the rooms spawn in a line, currently the grid can cause rooms to spawn over the entrance
Pressing B while moving an already place mutation breaks the menu, just dont allow B presses
Construction sites can have npcs manually assigned to them
When moving the camera around the camp the selection icon can move off into the distance, should also be bound by the building grid
Return to camp selection from roguelike is showing up when npcs die in camp  (might be only happening when the npc was possessed before it died)
After a building is constructed the taken grid prefabs are being enabled
NPCs still moving artound when they are dead






******Stuff for later******

Have to do some refactoring on the npc animator and what has access to it

Refactoring of managers, specifically the camp manager that yoke is doing a lot of stupid shit around the grid

NPCs have to use toilets, need to figure out timers for when they need it

Damaging buildings: ties into turret system
Repairing buildings: wait until damage is finished

Narrative diologue and recruiting NPCs
