*****Current Work*****

Finalizing game loops:

Camp management:

Clean system:
Next ppl get sick, stop working completely
Buildings to work on:
Check cleaning station still works
Toilet

Health system for settlers:
Settlers not treated will die, recover or turn to zombies eventually (this is just based on their age and luck)
They can increase chances of recovery by not working or even better receiving treatment.


****** Tomorrow work:

So climbing/falling working in camp. Isnt working in the toxic pools though so have to figure that out. Think its because the plane under it causes issues

****** Next work:

Add in some poise damage for enemy and player attacks which dictate if knockback animation should play

Need some close range attacks for ranged zombies

Visual effects from elemental weapons eg. zombies get shocked by electrical weapon, they freeze and particles are emitted.

VFX for player

Setup some new enemies: Zombie that when its killed splits into smaller enemies. Different types of robots and drones.


****** Bugs and refactoring:

PlayerUIManager ShowFloatingText, I dunno if we will even use this but its basically just text floating over npcs/building/enemies etc that we can add in

****** Errors:




****** Add to save load manager:

Construction, repair and destruction sites
Time of day


******Stuff for later******


NPCs have to use toilets, need to figure out timers for when they need it

Repairing buildings: wait until damage is finished

SaveLoadManager, have to implement saving/loading research, player data?, other player data for camp?, building data, cleaness and electricity, manager data? (? just means the ai put TODO there but not sure exactly what it means or what data is needed)

Filling out the overworld, having more options of buildings to select.

Create more room/building prefabs

Filling out sound and VFX

Status effects, adding sleep, work etc effects to npcs Also damage ones like fire electric, poison etc. Effects for work task buildings (camp fire smoke etc.)

Test upgrade and destruction effects for buildings


*****Ideas*****

Enemies
Slower animations for injured enemies

Mutations
One that shows enemies life bars

Research
Unlock vaulting and dash for roguelike to increase movement options
Strength that allows you to push heavier objects to open new areas

Buildings:
An alarm that will alert NPCs of an incoming zombie attack
