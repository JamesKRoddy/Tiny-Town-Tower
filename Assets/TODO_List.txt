*****Current Work*****


Tomorrow work:
Zombie spawn vfx is too big and rotated weird


Bugs and refactoring:
Some of the narrative text uses the npcs name, the text doesn't match the random name given to the npc
Instead of spawning enemies at fixed points, add in code to select random points on the nav mesh to spawn, also make sure they are at least 10 away from the players possessed npc . Then use the effect manager to do the vfx at the enemy spawn point
Damage animation for player and cooldown to take more damage
Have to do some refactoring on the npc animator and what has access to it
Refactoring of managers, specifically the camp manager that yoke is doing a lot of stupid shit around the grid (might just need to check this could already be done)




******Stuff for later******

VFX for player

NPCs have to use toilets, need to figure out timers for when they need it

Damaging buildings: ties into turret system
Repairing buildings: wait until damage is finished

SaveLoadManager, have to implement saving/loading research, player data?, other player data for camp?, building data, cleaness and electricity, manager data? (? just means the ai put TODO there but not sure exactly what it means or what data is needed)

Enviromental hazzards in the roguelike section enviromental hazzards, electrical/acid etc.

Filling out the overworld, having more options of buildings to select.

Create more room/building prefabs

Filling out sound and VFX

Visual effects from elemental weapons eg. zombies get shocked by electrical weapon, they freeze and particles are emitted.

Setup some new enemies: Zombie that when its killed splits into smaller enemies. Different types of robots and drones.

Implement a day/night cycle for the entire game. Figure out what happens in the camp while youre gone, does progress on stuff freeze? Does it keep going or does it progress but slower?
