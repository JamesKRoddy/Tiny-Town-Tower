*****Current Work*****

Roguelike Complete Level


Process:

Have to move new rooms to different coordinates
Door exit vfx so the player can go back
Setup non hostile rooms
Game loop of entering a building, completing waves, moving onto the next room, reaching the end of the building, transporting back to the overworld to the entrance of the building entered, either returning to camp or progressing onto another building.
Player death loop, loosing the npc and loot, loading back to the camp

Picking up genetic mutations and assigning them to the player, opening the screen placing them, showing mutation details when highlighted, exit popup to let player know unequipped ones will be dropped, discarding unequipped ones.

Instead of spawning enemies from the same points, add in code to select randow points on the nave mesh to spawn, spawn points!!!

After returning to camp adding picked up inventory items back to the inventory, unpossess npc, remove their genetic mutations.
Displaying npc mutations (charicteristics)

Implement a day/night cycle for the entire game.
Figure out what happens in the camp while youre gone, does progress on stuff freeze? Does it keep going or does it progress but slower?


Zombie sound effects
Enviromental hazzards, electrical/acid etc.
Visual effects from elemental weapons eg. zombies get shocked by electrical wepon, they freeze and particles are emitted.
Expanding the overworld, having more options of buildings to select.
Creating more rooms and buildings.
Setup some new enemies: Boomer that runs towards you and explodes.



Bugs

Player feels sticky when running into walls at an angle
Player moving through walls while attack animation is running
Enemy still doing attack flash while dead

Layout of where rooms are spawned is weird, just make it go in a line
Seems to spawn the same room parent each time







******Stuff for later******

Have to do some refactoring on the npc animator and what has access to it

Turret selection with default controls will have to do the same/tie in with TURRET_CAMERA_MOVEMENT	

NPCs have to use toilets, need to figure out timers for when they need it

Damaging buildings: ties into turret system
Repairing buildings: wait until damage is finished

Narrative diologue and recruiting NPCs
