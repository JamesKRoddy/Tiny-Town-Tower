*****Current Work*****


Tomorrow work:



Recruiting NPCs:

Conversation progression eg. after an npc is recruited then respond differently.
Slightly more complicated conversations, how to track them?

Randomly generating npcs, stats, models etc. in the npc manager.
Randomly generating NPC models
Randomly assigning narrative elements (have these stored in a specific place, in the json assign a character type or something and have it assigned by that?





Enviromental hazzards in the roguelike section enviromental hazzards, electrical/acid etc.

Filling out the overworld, having more options of buildings to select.

Create more room/building prefabs

Filling out sound and VFX

Visual effects from elemental weapons eg. zombies get shocked by electrical wepon, they freeze and particles are emitted.

Setup some new enemies: Boomer that runs towards you and explodes (elemental  variety too so the explosion leaves damage areas). Zombie that when its killed splits into smaller enemies.



Extras:
Instead of spawning enemies from the same points, add in code to select random points on the nave mesh to spawn, spawn points!!!
Implement a day/night cycle for the entire game.
Figure out what happens in the camp while youre gone, does progress on stuff freeze? Does it keep going or does it progress but slower?
Trash spawning in camp should take up spaces on the grid
Goal at the start just says survive, recruit 10 survivors



Bugs and refactoring:
In game quit button doesn't exit the game
Theres these small, medium and large enums for room sizes that need to be removed
Enemy waves in buildings the enemy wave scriptable obj has a reference to a building type. Maybe figure out a better way to handle it?
Overload




******Stuff for later******

VFX for player
Damage animation for player and cooldown to take more damage
Start setting up the player progression manager. Use this to keep track of what the player has unlocked

Have to do some refactoring on the npc animator and what has access to it

Refactoring of managers, specifically the camp manager that yoke is doing a lot of stupid shit around the grid

NPCs have to use toilets, need to figure out timers for when they need it

Damaging buildings: ties into turret system
Repairing buildings: wait until damage is finished

Save game UI already class made SaveGameUI.cs
